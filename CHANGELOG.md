## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Default` impl on `ApiFn` and `Param` in `src/servers/parse.rs`. Hand-written rather than derived because `syn::Type` (the `return_type_ast` / `ty_ast` fields) has no `Default`; both impls fall back to `syn::parse_quote!(())` for the AST fields, matching the existing pattern in `extract_result_ok_type`. The real parser path in `parse_api_module` still populates every field explicitly — `parse.rs` remains the unambiguous source of truth — but unit-test fixtures in `src/servers/tests.rs` now use `..Default::default()` tails. Adding a new field to either struct no longer cascades into editing every fixture (~20 sites previously); only the fixtures that exercise the new field's value need to change.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Reversed the HTTP-method classifier default for
  zero-user-param custom functions. Previously, any zero-user-param fn
  classified unconditionally as `OpKind::CustomGet` and routed as `GET`;
  now, only names matching a known-read prefix (`get_`, `list_`, `count_`,
  `exists_`, `find_`, `is_`, `has_`) opt back into `CustomGet`. Everything
  else defaults to `OpKind::CustomPost` (routes as `POST`), per RFC 7231
  §4.2.1 (GET is for retrieval, not action). Action-verb handlers like
  `pause(state)`, `backup(state)`, `reset_all(state)` now correctly emit as
  `POST` without needing an explicit `#[ontogen::http::post]` annotation.
  Consumer-side migration: rename false-positive zero-user-param read
  handlers to a known-read prefix (e.g. `workout` → `get_workout`), or
  carry a forced-method override (today: `#[ontogen::http::post]` to keep
  an action verb's POST routing explicit; a symmetric `::get` opt-in is
  filed as a follow-up if false positives accumulate). The companion
  task `2026-05-24-ontogen-classifier-add-post-attribute-opt-in` shipped
  the POST override one alpha tag ahead so consumers could pre-annotate
  on the old default.
